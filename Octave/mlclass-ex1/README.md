# Linear Regression*

implement linear regression and get to see it work on data.

Submitted by: **Tristan Yan**

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] [warmUpExercise.m](./warmUpExercise.m) - Simple example function in Octave/MATLAB 
* [X] [plotData.m](plotData.m) - Function to display the dataset
* [X] [computeCost.m](computeCost.m) - Function to compute the cost of linear regression
* [X] [gradientDescent.m](gradientDescent.m) - Function to run gradient descent

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] [computeCostMulti.m](computeCostMulti.m) - Cost function for multiple variables
* [X] [gradientDescentMulti.m](gradientDescentMulti.m) - Gradient descent for multiple variables 
* [X] [featureNormalize.m](featureNormalize.m) - Function to normalize features
* [X] [normalEqn.m](normalEqn.m) - Function to compute the normal equations

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of gradient descent for one variable:
