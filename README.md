Haibo's Machine Learning Code Practice

I've been practiced machine learning since 2015. This is trying to capture all the experiments I've done for machine learning. Which includes:

* Early study on coursera. It's using Octava
* Some practice with Python
* New study on tensorflow
* Practice on Spark-MLLib
* Recent deeplearning.ai course assignment
